Question: How do you check the system logs for errors?
Answer: Use journalctl -xe or check /var/log/ files like /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/secure for errors.

Question: How do you troubleshoot a service that is failing to start?
Answer: Check systemctl status <service>, view logs with journalctl -u <service> -xe, verify config files, fix issues, then restart the service.

Question: How do you recover a system stuck in emergency mode?
Answer: Check errors with journalctl -xb, fix fstab or filesystem issues using fsck, remount / as rw, then exit or reboot.

Question: What is the purpose of the dmesg command?
Answer: Displays kernel messages—useful for diagnosing hardware, driver, or boot issues.

Question: How do you troubleshoot network connectivity issues in Linux?
Answer: Check IP with ip a, test with ping, check routes ip route, DNS via nslookup, and firewall using iptables or firewall-cmd.

Question: How to Login via single user mode in RHEL 7 ?
Answer: Boot the system , go to GRUB2 boot loader Screen, Press ‘e’ and go to the line which starts with ‘linux16/vmlinz‘ and replace ‘ro‘ with ‘rw init=/sysroot/bin/bash‘ and Press ctrl-x to boot.

Question: System Utilization & Diagnostics
Answer: Core tools for monitoring: 
 top, vmstat, iostat, dmesg, lsof, fuser, pmap, ps, sar, strace, watch, stress.
journalctl -xb              # Logs from last boot
journalctl -k               # Kernel logs
dmesg  -T| less             # Kernel ring buffer

Question: Restore deleted LV:
Answer: vgcfgrestore vg01 -f /etc/lvm/archive/ ; lvchange -a y /dev/vg01/lv01

Question: What is a Kernel Panic in Linux?
Answer: A kernel panic occurs when the Linux kernel encounters a fatal error that it cannot safely recover from, such as a hardware failure, driver bug, or invalid memory access. The system halts or reboots to prevent further damage.

Question: What are common causes of a Kernel Panic?
Answer:
Faulty or incompatible kernel modules/drivers
Corrupt initramfs or kernel image
Hardware issues (RAM, disk, CPU)
Filesystem corruption or missing system libraries
Misconfigured boot parameters or SELinux policies

Question: How do you troubleshoot a Kernel Panic?
Answer:
Boot into rescue or recovery mode.
Check logs in /var/log/messages, /var/log/kern.log, or journalctl -xb.
Verify recent kernel/module changes.
Test memory with memtest86+.
Check hardware connections and drivers.
Reinstall or roll back to a stable kernel.

Question: How can you prevent Kernel Panics?
Answer: Keep kernel and drivers updated from trusted sources.
Avoid manual module modification unless necessary.
Regularly monitor hardware health (SMART, sensors).
Maintain tested kernel backups and use GRUB to boot previous versions.

Question: What is Filesystem Corruption?
Answer: Filesystem corruption occurs when metadata or data structures that define file storage become inconsistent or damaged, leading to unreadable or lost data.

Question: What causes Filesystem Corruption in Linux?
Answer: Unexpected shutdowns or power failures
Disk or controller hardware failure
Kernel bugs or driver issues
Overfilled disks or improper unmounting
RAID/sync issues or bad sectors

Question: How do you check and repair filesystem corruption?
Answer: Boot into single-user or rescue mode.
Unmount the affected partition.
Run fsck /dev/sdXn to scan and repair errors.
Review logs in /var/log/fsck/.
Reboot and verify with mount and dmesg.

Question: How can you prevent filesystem corruption?
Answer: Use reliable hardware and UPS for power stability.
Enable journaling filesystems (e.g., ext4, XFS).
Schedule periodic fsck checks.
Maintain proper disk usage (<90%).
Ensure clean shutdowns and RAID sync.

Question: How are kernel panic and filesystem corruption related?
Answer: Filesystem corruption can cause kernel panics if critical files or drivers become unreadable at boot or runtime. Conversely, a kernel panic during write operations may leave filesystems in an inconsistent stat
